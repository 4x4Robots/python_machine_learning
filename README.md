# Machine learning in Python

Experiments with machine learning, expert systems and neural nets in Python.

## Quickstart

If you don't have already, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Then select a topic you want to explore and create the corresponding `venv` using uv.
Finally to open [marimo notenbooks](https://docs.marimo.io/) use `marimo edit`

```sh
pip install uv
cd python_machine_learning/src/fuzzy_logic
uv sync
marimo edit
```
